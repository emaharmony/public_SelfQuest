Dear Developers who use Mystic Forest 3D pack!


- There are 2 shaders used in this pack: Mobile Transparent Vertex Color and Alpha-DiffuseDoubleSide

   * Mobile Transparent Vertex Color : help decrease drawcall but no react on light and no shadow. Specially, need to turn off "allow HDR" mode of camera if use with Unity 2017. Find in Shader: Mobile/Transparent/VertexColor

   * Alpha-DiffuseDoubleSide: help view double-side, react on light and receive shader. Can cause increase drawcall. Find in Shader: Transparent/Cutout/DiffuseDoubleSide 


If there is any problem, please feel free to contact me at souchenki@gmail.com
